## Introduction

This project focuses on performing exploratory analysis on a dataset related to heart health. Exploratory Data Analysis is conducted to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, correlations, and insights that might be useful for predictive modeling.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset). It comprises various attributes related to heart health, including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. 

## Analysis Overview

The analysis includes various steps such as data preprocessing, visualization of important features, correlation analysis, statistical summaries, and potentially predictive modeling.

## Files

- `heart.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `Heart_Attack_Prediction_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the repository.

## Dependencies

The analysis was conducted using Python programming language and the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

To replicate or explore this analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Open and run the `Heart_Attack_Prediction_EDA.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Results

The results of this exploratory analysis are documented within the Jupyter Notebook (`Heart_Attack_Prediction_EDA.ipynb`). The insights gained from the analysis may help in understanding the factors associated with heart attacks and could be used as a foundation for further predictive modeling.
